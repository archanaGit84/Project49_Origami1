        <ol>
            <li>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.</li>
            <li>Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.</li>
            <li>Camels can completely shut their nostrils during sandstorms</li>
            <li>Camels can travel at up to 40 miles per hour – the same as a racehorse!</li>
            <li>Don’t make a camel angry – they can spit as a way to distract whatever they think is a threat</li>
            <li>Their humps let them store up to 80 pounds of fat which they can live off for weeks and even months!</li>
